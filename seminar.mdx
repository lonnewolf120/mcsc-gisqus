Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs, are an integral part of contemporary software development. As APIs enable critical data sharing among multiple programs, they are also at a greater risk of being cyber-attacked—resulting in mass data loss, service disruption, and access violations.

To address this impending threat, **MIST LeetCon 2023** will feature an interactive 𝐨𝐧𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞 workshop titled **"𝐀𝐏𝐈 𝐒𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝟐𝟎𝟐𝟑”** on **𝟐𝟎 𝐌𝐚𝐲 𝟐𝟎𝟐𝟑 (𝐒𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐝𝐚𝐲)** from **𝟐:𝟎𝟎 𝐏𝐌 𝐭𝐨 𝟐:𝟒𝟓 𝐏𝐌 (𝐁𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐥𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐬𝐡 𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞)** with **𝐀𝐥𝐞𝐱 𝐎𝐥𝐬𝐞𝐧**, content creator at TCM Security and a renowned expert in API security. In his presentation, he will share practical insights and best practices for securing APIs.

Although the session will be held online, attendees will have the opportunity to participate in a Q\&A session with Alex and engage in discussions on the latest trends and challenges in API security.

With the wonderful opportunity to enhance your API security knowledge, don’t miss out on the session! Registration is now open. We encourage you to sign up early to secure your spot!
